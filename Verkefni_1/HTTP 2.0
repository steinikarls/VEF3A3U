HTTP 2.0

what is the biggest diffrence between http 1.1 and http 2.0?

there are a number of improvements but ghe biggest one is that performence boost it gives.
also that the HTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management. this reasults in reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.

What are the key differences to HTTP/1.x?
At a high level, HTTP/2:

is binary, instead of textual
is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
can therefore use one connection for parallelism
uses header compression to reduce overhead
allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches
